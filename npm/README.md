# @carbonenginejs/runtime-trinity

Faithful CarbonEngine Trinity/Eve scene-graph model (the serializable Trinity
Graph) and visual resource classes. Ports Tr2*/Eve* 1:1 from CarbonEngine.
GPU-free.

Part of the CarbonEngineJS runtime/engine tier. GPU-free JavaScript source,
decorated for CarbonEngineJS schema metadata.

## Status

Active Carbon-faithful ports cover generated schema classes plus handwritten
controller, curve, Eve, particle, shader-model, and utility behavior.
`tools-core` owns Carbon scanning, schema generation, and class emission.
Reviewed generated output is copied into `src/generated`; this package does
not import `tools-core` or depend on its workspace or scratch directories.

This runtime owns serializable CPU-side state and behavior. Geometry, texture,
and effect resources are supplied by resource runtimes; WebGPU/WebGL device,
upload, binding, and destruction lifecycles belong to renderer runtimes.

## WebGPU Main semantic extraction

Two GPU-free helpers expose the proven runtime values needed by the first
bounded Eve space-object Main binding profile:

- `extractTr2EffectConstantValues(effect, reflectedConstants)` reads only the
  requested reflected float constants across `parameters` and
  `constParameters`. Dynamic parameters use `CopyValueToEffect`, preserving
  rerouted values and sRGB-to-linear conversion. Missing, duplicate, malformed,
  array, resource-like, or unsupported values fail closed.
- `createEveSpaceObjectMainPerObjectValues({ object, shared, shipData,
  vsOverrides, psOverrides })` maps `EveSpaceObject2` transform aliases,
  trustworthy clip values, `EveSpacePerObjectData` fields/SH alias, and custom
  masks into frozen plain `perObjectVS`/`perObjectPS` values.

The per-object precedence is object-derived values, then explicitly supplied
shared data, then VS/PS overrides. `shipData` is always required because no
source-proven builder currently exists. Ellipsoid `w`, screen size, morph/bone
offsets, impact fields, and similar optional values are copied only when the
shared data or overrides supply them; they are never guessed.

There is deliberately no per-frame scene builder yet. Previous matrices,
shadow state, projection conventions, gamma/mip policy, frame/jitter values,
resolution, and other renderer-owned state are not completely represented by
the Trinity scene graph. The active renderer must provide the complete
`perFrameVS` and `perFramePS` semantic objects before an engine serializer is
called.

Baseline checks:

```sh
npm run build:npm
npm test
```

## Turrets and missiles

The maintained Eve combat-effect graph now includes Carbon's portable turret,
stretch, and MIRV missile behavior:

- `EveMobile` maps authored `locator_*` transforms (and optional animated bone
  transforms) into `EveTurretSet` instances. Turret sets own state changes,
  paired turret/damage-locator selection, looping-fire rechecks, tracking fades,
  muzzle transforms, target updates, firing effects, and ambient/controller
  forwarding.
- `EveSpaceObject2` supplies the targetable damage-locator, miss-position,
  radius, impact-material, and shield-ellipsoid collision surface consumed by
  both turrets and missiles.
- `EveTransform`, `EveMissile`, and `EveMissileWarhead` own CPU transforms,
  launch/eject/tracking states, Carbon fixed-seed Perlin path offsets, target
  switching, impacts, explosion callbacks, particles, visibility, and dynamic
  MIRV bounds. `EveMissileWarheadPerObjectData` publishes the portable matrix
  and missile-size record.
- `EveEffectRoot2` and `EveRootTransform` own detached effect placement,
  controller/curve propagation, targetable sphere behavior, child update and
  renderable traversal, and authored effect LOD. This makes effect-root impact
  graphs executable without making Trinity responsible for their draw calls.

Native animation-pose realization, geometry/resource loading, quad submission,
draw batches, device buffers, and shader uploads remain renderer/runtime-engine
responsibilities. Trinity exposes duck-typed pose, emitter, renderable, and
constant-data seams without importing a browser graphics API. A generated
effect child remains data-only until its own maintained runtime behavior is
implemented; root traversal does not invent missing child rendering behavior.

Character GState ownership lives in `runtime-character`:
`Tr2GStateAnimation` and `Tr2GStateParameter` are not Trinity exports. The
generic `Tr2GrannyAnimation` graph remains here for non-character skinned
geometry, while `Tr2GrannyStateRes` remains a runtime-resource class.

## Implementation-gap audit

Explicit generated and maintained implementation gaps can be inventoried with:

```sh
npm run audit:gaps
```

The command reports `@impl.notImplemented` methods and `@type.unknown`
properties by class, family, source owner, and line. It excludes `src/dropped`
by default because every quarantined file has a file-specific disposition in
`src/dropped/README.md`; use `-- --include-dropped` only to inspect that
quarantine. Marker output is a lower bound: maintained classes must also be
checked against Carbon public headers, interfaces, implementations, and Blue
exposure to find methods omitted rather than stubbed.

As of 2026-07-20, the audited in-scope snapshot contains 129 explicit method
gaps across 34 classes and no unknown properties, down from 389/106 and 85/34
respectively. The completed wave covers Carbon's
missing `EveSpaceObject2` bounds/frustum surface, CPU primitive and line
collections, line graphs, render-debug accumulation and backend-neutral render
intents, bullet-storm/explosion lifecycle behavior, child controller/resource
forwarding, tactical trails, and ship booster-locator rebuilding. Remaining
gaps are concentrated in coherent native, GPU, font, animation, bitmap/atlas,
particle, scene-picking, and swarm families; they are intentionally still
explicit until a browser owner or backend seam is established.

The child reference/socket resource seam is synchronous and injected. Socket
parameter auto-creation currently covers the emitted string parameter type;
additional Carbon template types require corresponding `tools-core` emission
before runtime-trinity can own them faithfully.

Calculated whole-object bounds are planned as a separate lazy cache rather
than a mutation of Carbon's authored culling bounds. The intended object-local
box and sphere caches use `__state.flags` token `"bounds"`; only a successful
`GetObjectBounding*` recomputation clears it. World AABBs derive from the local
cache and current transform. Explicit visual ownership paths—not generic model
graph traversal—decide which children, attachments, turrets, boosters, and
dynamic effects contribute.

## Graph ownership and GPU realization

Carbon class ownership follows graph fidelity, not graphics terminology.
`TriDevice`, `TriRenderJob`, render steps, render contexts, targets, buffers,
effects, shaders and presentation records remain canonical Trinity classes.
They describe Carbon object graphs and must be registerable, hydratable,
inspectable and serializable without a canvas or GPU backend.

Those classes do not own live GPU objects. WebGPU and WebGL engines separately
own resource realization, context/device loss, synchronization, presentation,
uploads, pipelines/programs, bindings, command execution and destruction.
Backend objects must stay outside persisted schema fields, normally in
engine-owned associations.

We deliberately do not insert a `runtime-device` package between Trinity and
the engines. WebGPU and WebGL have materially different lifecycles; a shared
device lifecycle would either leak backend concepts or become a misleading
lowest-common-denominator abstraction. Applications or `runtime-core` may
select and inject an engine directly. A separate shared contract should only be
introduced after two real engines demonstrate a stable common seam that is
larger than structural capability checks.

This keeps the package graph small and avoids constructor duplication,
cross-package enum ownership, import-order registration, partial inheritance
families, and generator exclusions for classes that are still graph data.

## Render-job execution contract

`TriRenderJob` and `Tr2RenderJobs` own Carbon's backend-neutral execution
semantics: ordered step snapshots, `RJ_IN_PROGRESS` cursor persistence, nested
job result mapping, recurring/once/chained scheduling, and target/depth stack
validation and unwind. `TriRenderJob` exposes its status vocabulary as class
statics; `TriRenderStep` does the same for step results.

`Run(realTime, simTime, executor)` accepts a duck-typed executor/context. Trinity
stores no generic RHI object and defines no `CjsRenderGraphExecutor` helper.
WebGL may execute a step immediately; WebGPU may plan pass boundaries and encode
commands, but both must preserve the observable order and yield boundary.
Nested jobs receive the same executor identity.

The default `Tr2RenderContext` is only a GPU-free intent stack and diagnostic
surface. Live contexts, targets, encoders, command buffers, handles,
presentation, and device-loss state remain engine-owned. JS execution
intentionally hardens Carbon's exception and leaked-stack paths with
deterministic `finally` cleanup and diagnostics.

Maintained target/depth, clear, viewport, view, projection, resolve, copy,
mipmap and presentation steps normalize Carbon arguments into this intent
surface. They do not import WebGL/WebGPU APIs or decide pass boundaries.

## Post-process graph contract

`Tr2PostProcess2` and `Tr2PostProcessAttributes` are device-free graph classes.
Trinity owns effect activation and quality gates, LUT ordering, priority/intensity
volume blending, and the rebuilding of authored effect records. The 56 Carbon
post-process attributes are exposed as their exact enabled/value pairs; macro
placeholders are not part of the JavaScript contract.

Live post-processing remains backend work. WebGL and WebGPU executors must
independently realize temporary and persistent textures, exposure buffers,
TAA/upscaler history, compute or fragment alternatives, fullscreen passes,
readback, and loss recovery. They must preserve Carbon's observable pass order,
but Trinity does not prescribe a shared RHI or serialize those internal passes
as `TriRenderStep` objects.
